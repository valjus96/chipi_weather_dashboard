Gui builded using customtkinter by Tom Schimansky, thanks!

This simple software is designed to be left running for non defined amount of time and display weather statistics fetched from Openweather.org based on specific location and update cycles defined by the user. Created as part of my own raspberry pi project, and main window is designed to fill a 10.1 inch screen and be run on a Raspberry pi Zero 2.

Currently still work-in-progress, but already in active use in my household. Stable and reliable. I'm planning to expand ChiPi Weather in the near future to include:
--tabs to fill with other features.
--7 day weather forecasts with in-depth weather information.
--daily horoscopes based on the user's zodiac sign.
--weather warnings
--some kinds of daily facts based on the current date or something
--Work on producing more artwork for different conditions/night alternatives.
--Making the gui more aesthetically pleasing
--More chibi
--Even more chibi

Note that to use this software you must have your own openweather api-key that you can request from the openweather website (https://openweathermap.org/).

Feel free to use and modify this software to suit it better for your own projects, but please be mindful of not claiming this is completely your own creation. Credits, feedbacks as well as constructive criticism and suggestions are greatly appreciated!
